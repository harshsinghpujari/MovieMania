          Movie Mania is a simple React-based web app that allows you to search for movies, 
          explore trending picks, and view details like title, release year, and type. 
          It uses the OMDB API as its movie database source. ðŸŽ¬

          This project was built to practice React, API integration, and responsive design.
          Itâ€™s part of my journey into full-stack development. ðŸš€
